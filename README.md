# game-journal
a personal game library journal that I can access privately from anywhere. The app should allow me to log games I’m currently playing, track whether I’m enjoying them, and rate how motivated I am to finish each one. It also helps me manage my backlog by organizing and ranking unplayed games by category, so I always know what I should pick up next.
